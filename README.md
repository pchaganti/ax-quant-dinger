## Try in 2 minutes

**Prerequisites:** [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) with Compose (Docker Desktop on Windows/macOS, or Docker Engine + Compose plugin on Linux), and **Git**. Node.js is **not** required (prebuilt UI is in `frontend/dist`).

### macOS / Linux (Bash)

One line (or run the same steps separately):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/brokermr810/QuantDinger.git && cd QuantDinger && cp backend_api_python/env.example backend_api_python/.env && chmod +x scripts/generate-secret-key.sh && ./scripts/generate-secret-key.sh && docker-compose up -d --build
```

If `./scripts/generate-secret-key.sh` fails with “Permission denied”, run `chmod +x scripts/generate-secret-key.sh` and retry. If `docker-compose` is not found, try `docker compose` (Compose V2).

### Windows (PowerShell)

Use **PowerShell** (not CMD) in a folder where you want the project. **Docker Desktop** must be running (WSL2 backend recommended).

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/brokermr810/QuantDinger.git
Set-Location QuantDinger
Copy-Item backend_api_python\env.example -Destination backend_api_python\.env
$key = & python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))" 2>$null
if (-not $key) { $key = & py -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))" 2>$null }
if (-not $key) { $key = & python3 -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))" 2>$null }
if (-not $key) { Write-Error "Install Python 3 from python.org (tick 'Add to PATH') or use Git Bash with the macOS/Linux block above." }
(Get-Content backend_api_python\.env) -replace '^SECRET_KEY=.*$', "SECRET_KEY=$key" | Set-Content backend_api_python\.env -Encoding utf8
docker-compose up -d --build
```

If `docker-compose` is not recognized, use **`docker compose`** (space, no hyphen). If Git is missing, install [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win).

### Windows alternative: Git Bash

If you installed **Git for Windows**, open **Git Bash** and you can use the **macOS / Linux** one-liner above (Bash + `chmod` + `./scripts/generate-secret-key.sh`).

---

Then open **`http://localhost:8888`**, sign in with **`quantdinger` / `123456`**, and **change the default admin password** before any real use. For prerequisites, configuration details, first-run checks, and troubleshooting, continue to **[Installation & first-time setup](#installation--first-time-setup-docker-compose)** below.

## What is QuantDinger?

QuantDinger is built for people who want **one controlled environment** instead of stitching together chart apps, Jupyter, bots, and dashboards:

- **Research**: AI-driven analysis, watchlists, and multi-market context (crypto, equities, forex, optional prediction-market workflows).
- **Build**: Indicator-style (`IndicatorStrategy`) and script-style (`ScriptStrategy`) Python; optional natural-language → code to bootstrap.
- **Validate**: Server-side backtests, metrics, and equity curves tied to the same strategy model you iterate in the UI.
- **Operate**: Live strategies, quick trade, notifications, and execution adapters—credentials stay in **your** Postgres-backed vault and `.env`.
- **Grow (optional)**: Multi-user patterns, credits, memberships, and USDT billing hooks for teams that ship a product, not only a personal bot.

If you are looking for an **open-source quant stack**, **self-hosted AI trading workspace**, or **NL → Python strategy workflow** with a real operator surface, this repository is the integration point.

## Why QuantDinger? AI-Powered Quantitative Trading and Backtesting

- **Self-hosted by design**: your credentials, strategy code, market workflows, and operational data stay under your control.
- **Research to execution in one product**: AI analysis, charting, strategy logic, backtests, quick trade, and live operations are connected.
- **Python-native and AI-assisted**: write indicators and strategies directly in Python, or use AI to accelerate drafting and iteration.
- **Built for operators, not just demos**: Docker Compose, PostgreSQL, Redis, Nginx, health checks, worker toggles, and environment-based configuration.
- **Commercialization-ready**: memberships, credits, admin management, and USDT payment flows are already part of the stack.

## The Core Promise

QuantDinger gives you something most trading tools do not:

- **one stack instead of five** for research, strategy code, backtests, execution, alerts, and operations
- **AI that sits inside the workflow**, not beside it
- **Python flexibility without losing product UX**
- **private deployment without giving up growth features**

## QuantDinger vs Patchwork Setups

| Typical Setup | QuantDinger |
|---------------|-------------|
| AI chat tool disconnected from real strategy workflows | AI analysis, AI code generation, backtest feedback, and execution workflows live in one product |
| Separate charting app, Python scripts, bot runner, and notification stack | One deployable platform for charting, strategy logic, runtime services, and alerts |
| Hosted SaaS with limited control over credentials and alpha | Self-hosted architecture with your own infra, keys, and operational data |
| Research tools with no operator layer | Multi-user roles, billing, credits, admin controls, and deployment-ready configuration |

## Who It Is For

- **Traders and quants** who want AI-assisted market research without giving up control of infrastructure and data.
- **Python strategy developers** who want charting, backtests, and live execution in one environment.
- **Small teams and studios** building internal trading tools or private research platforms.
- **Operators and founders** who need a deployable product with user management, billing, and admin controls.

## Use Cases

- **AI-assisted market research** for crypto, stocks, forex, and cross-market workflows
- **Python-native strategy development** for quantitative trading and algorithmic trading teams
- **Backtesting and iteration** for signal strategies, saved strategies, and execution assumptions
- **Private trading infrastructure** for teams that want self-hosted deployment and privacy-first operations
- **Commercial trading products** that need users, billing, credits, and admin controls

### Polymarket and Cross-Market Research

- Analyze prediction markets as a research workflow
- Compare AI view versus market-implied probabilities
- Surface divergence and opportunity scoring

## Why It Is Different

Most trading stacks give you one or two of these pieces. QuantDinger aims to give you the full operating system:

1. **Self-hosted infrastructure**
2. **AI research workflows**
3. **Python strategy development**
4. **Backtesting**
5. **Live execution**
6. **Portfolio and notification operations**
7. **Commercialization primitives**

That combination is the core difference.

## Why It Converts Better Than a Typical Trading Tool

- **For traders**: it shortens the path from idea to execution.
- **For quants**: it keeps Python and strategy control front and center.
- **For operators**: it adds the parts most open-source trading projects skip, including users, billing, roles, and deployability.
- **For AI-first workflows**: it turns analysis into something actionable, reviewable, and eventually automatable.

## How It Works

At a practical level, QuantDinger runs as a self-hosted application stack:

- a prebuilt Vue frontend served by Nginx
- a Flask API backend with Python services
- PostgreSQL for state, users, strategies, and history
- Redis for worker support and runtime coordination
- exchange, broker, AI, payment, and notification integrations through configurable adapters

### Architecture Summary

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| Frontend | Prebuilt Vue application served by Nginx |
| Backend | Flask API, Python services, strategy runtime |
| Storage | PostgreSQL 16 |
| Cache / worker support | Redis 7 |
| Trading layer | Exchange adapters, IBKR, MT5 |
| AI layer | LLM provider integration, memory, calibration, optional workers |
| Billing | Membership, credits, USDT TRC20 payment flow |
| Deployment | Docker Compose with health checks |

### Execution Model

- Market data is pulled through a pluggable data layer.
- Backtests run on the server-side strategy engine, including strategy snapshot handling.
- Live strategies run through runtime services that generate order intent.
- Pending orders are then dispatched through exchange-specific execution adapters.
- Crypto live execution is intentionally separated from market-data collection concerns.

## Installation & first-time setup (Docker Compose)

This section mirrors a typical “local deploy” path: **prepare the host → obtain the code → configure secrets → start the stack → verify → harden → optionally wire AI**. Node.js is **not** required: the repo ships a **prebuilt** UI under `frontend/dist` and Nginx serves it inside the `frontend` container.

### Prerequisites

| Item | Notes |
|------|--------|
| [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) + Docker Compose v2 | Used for Postgres, Redis, API, and static UI. |
| `git` | To clone this repository. |
| Ports (defaults) | `8888` (web), `5000` (API, bound to **127.0.0.1**), `5432` / `6379` (DB/Redis, loopback by default). Change via root `.env` if they collide. |
| Disk | Postgres volume grows with users, strategies, and logs; plan a few GB minimum for serious use. |

### 1) Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/brokermr810/QuantDinger.git
cd QuantDinger
```

### 2) Create backend configuration (mandatory)

```bash
cp backend_api_python/env.example backend_api_python/.env
```

Almost all runtime behavior is driven by **`backend_api_python/.env`** (database URL, admin user, LLM keys, workers, billing toggles, etc.). The optional **repository root** `.env` only adjusts Compose-level concerns such as **ports** and **image mirrors** (`IMAGE_PREFIX`).

### 3) Set `SECRET_KEY` before the first boot (mandatory)

The API **refuses to start** if `SECRET_KEY` is still the placeholder from `env.example`. This blocks accidental insecure deployments.

**Linux / macOS** (recommended):

```bash
./scripts/generate-secret-key.sh
```

The script overwrites the `SECRET_KEY=` line in `backend_api_python/.env` using Python’s `secrets` module.

**Manual** (any OS): generate a long random string (for example 64 hex chars) and set `SECRET_KEY=...` in `backend_api_python/.env`.

### 4) Start the stack

```bash
docker-compose up -d --build
```

Services: **`postgres`**, **`redis`**, **`backend`**, **`frontend`** (see `docker-compose.yml` for healthchecks and port mappings).

### 5) Verify and sign in

| Check | URL / command |
|--------|----------------|
| Web UI | `http://localhost:8888` (override host/port with `FRONTEND_HOST` / `FRONTEND_PORT` in root `.env` if needed). |
| API health | `http://localhost:5000/api/health` |
| Logs | `docker-compose logs -f backend` |

Default admin (change immediately in production):

- **User**: `quantdinger`
- **Password**: `123456` (from `env.example`; override with `ADMIN_USER` / `ADMIN_PASSWORD` in `.env` before first use if you prefer).

Also set **`FRONTEND_URL`** in `backend_api_python/.env` to the URL users actually use (including `https://` behind a reverse proxy); it affects redirects, CORS-related settings, and some generated links.

### 6) Optional: enable AI features

AI analysis, NL→code, and related flows need at least one LLM provider configured. Open `backend_api_python/env.example`, find the **AI / LLM** block, copy the relevant keys into your `.env` (for example `LLM_PROVIDER` + `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, or another supported provider). Restart the backend after edits.

### 7) Windows notes

Use **Docker Desktop** (WSL2 backend recommended). From PowerShell in the repo root:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/brokermr810/QuantDinger.git
cd QuantDinger
Copy-Item backend_api_python\env.example -Destination backend_api_python\.env
$key = py -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"
(Get-Content backend_api_python\.env) -replace '^SECRET_KEY=.*$', "SECRET_KEY=$key" | Set-Content backend_api_python\.env -Encoding UTF8
docker-compose up -d --build
```

If `py` is not on PATH, use `python` or `python3` in the one-liner that generates `$key`. Line endings should remain UTF-8; avoid editors that strip newlines from `.env`.

### Troubleshooting (first boot)

| Symptom | What to check |
|---------|----------------|
| Backend exits immediately | `SECRET_KEY` still default, or invalid `.env` syntax. Read `docker-compose logs backend`. |
| Blank page or API errors from browser | `FRONTEND_URL` / origins mismatch; API not reachable from the host you opened. |
| Port already in use | Another Postgres, Redis, or local service on `5432` / `6379` / `5000` / `8888`. Adjust variables in root `.env` per `docker-compose.yml`. |
| Many live strategies, “start denied” | Raise `STRATEGY_MAX_THREADS` in `backend_api_python/.env` and restart API (see comments in `env.example`). |

### Common Docker commands

```bash
docker-compose ps
docker-compose logs -f backend
docker-compose restart backend
docker-compose up -d --build
docker-compose down
```

### Optional root `.env` (Compose only)

For **custom ports** or **mirror/prefix** for base images (slow Docker Hub pulls), create a file named `.env` in the **repository root** (same directory as `docker-compose.yml`):

```ini
FRONTEND_PORT=3000
BACKEND_PORT=127.0.0.1:5001
IMAGE_PREFIX=docker.m.daocloud.io/library/
```

Production-style TLS, domain, and reverse-proxy placement are covered in **[Cloud deployment](docs/CLOUD_DEPLOYMENT_EN.md)**.

### Suggested first session (product walkthrough)

After the stack is healthy: (1) run an **AI asset / market analysis** so LLM and data paths are verified; (2) open the **Indicator IDE**, load a symbol, and run a **signal backtest** on a small date range; (3) optionally use **AI code generation** to draft an indicator, then edit the Python; (4) when ready, attach **exchange API keys** (profile / credentials), use **test connection**, then explore **live strategy** or **quick trade** with execution mode you intend. This order surfaces configuration issues early before real capital.

## Minimal Example: Python Indicator Strategy

This is the kind of Python-native strategy logic QuantDinger is designed for:

```python
# @param sma_short int 14 Short moving average
# @param sma_long int 28 Long moving average

sma_short_period = params.get('sma_short', 14)
sma_long_period = params.get('sma_long', 28)

my_indicator_name = "Dual Moving Average Strategy"
my_indicator_description = f"SMA {sma_short_period}/{sma_long_period} crossover"

df = df.copy()
sma_short = df["close"].rolling(sma_short_period).mean()
sma_long = df["close"].rolling(sma_long_period).mean()

buy = (sma_short > sma_long) & (sma_short.shift(1) <= sma_long.shift(1))
sell = (sma_short < sma_long) & (sma_short.shift(1) >= sma_long.shift(1))

df["buy"] = buy.fillna(False).astype(bool)
df["sell"] = sell.fillna(False).astype(bool)
```

## Strategy Development Modes

QuantDinger supports two main strategy authoring models:

### IndicatorStrategy

- dataframe-based Python scripts
- `buy` / `sell` signal generation
- chart rendering and signal-style backtests
- best for research, indicator logic, and visual strategy prototyping

### ScriptStrategy

- event-driven `on_init(ctx)` / `on_bar(ctx, bar)` scripts
- explicit runtime control with `ctx.buy()`, `ctx.sell()`, `ctx.close_position()`
- best for stateful strategies, execution-oriented logic, and live alignment

For the full developer workflow, see:

- [Strategy Development Guide](docs/STRATEGY_DEV_GUIDE.md)
- [Cross-Sectional Strategy Guide](docs/CROSS_SECTIONAL_STRATEGY_GUIDE_EN.md)
- [Strategy Examples](docs/examples/)

The example scripts live in `docs/examples/` and are kept aligned with the current strategy development guides.

## FAQ

### Is QuantDinger really self-hosted?

Yes. The default deployment model is your own Docker Compose stack with your own database, Redis instance, credentials, and environment configuration.

### Is QuantDinger only for crypto trading?

No. Crypto is a major focus, but the platform also includes IBKR workflows for US stocks, MT5 workflows for forex, and Polymarket research support.

### Can I write strategies directly in Python?

Yes. QuantDinger supports both dataframe-style `IndicatorStrategy` development and event-driven `ScriptStrategy` development. You can also use AI to generate a starting point and then edit it yourself.

### Is this a research tool or a live trading platform?

It is both. QuantDinger is built to connect AI research, charting, strategy development, backtesting, quick trade flows, and live execution operations in one system.

### Can I use QuantDinger commercially?

The backend is licensed under Apache 2.0. The frontend source has a separate source-available license. Commercial use is supported, but you should review the licensing terms in this repository and contact the project for frontend/commercial authorization if needed.
